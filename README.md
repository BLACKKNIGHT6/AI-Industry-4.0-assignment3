Real life scenario:
imagine a busy hospital emergency room where patients arrive at different times and ahve different levels of urgency.
given the data below, use the FCFS, SJF , PS, AND RR scheduling algorithms to determine the order in which patents should be attended to.
after applying each, discuss which one provides the most efficient and fair scheduling.
patient: A,B,C,D
arrival time: 00:00,00:10,00:15,00:20
estimated treatment time:30minutes,20minutes,40minutes,15minutes
urgency level(1-5,5 being most urgent):3,5,2,4
the values of arrival time, burst time, priority are with respect to each of the process in the order as followed.
Process scheduling algorithm:
given the following processes with their arrival times and burst times,
schedule the processes using FCFS, SJf, PS, and RR( with a time quantum of 4 units) algorithms.
after scheduling, determine the waiting time and turnaround time for each process in each scheduling algorithm.
finally, analyze which algorithm is the most suitable based on the average waiting time and average turnaround time.
process: P1,P2,P3,P4
arrival time: 0,4,5,6
burst Time :24,3,3,12
priority:3,1,4,2
the values of arrival time, burst time, priority are with respect to each of the process in the order as followed.
